karan Project Solutions
========
This repository will contain my solutions to some of the project ideas created by karan, which can be found at https://github.com/karan/Projects.

The folder structure is organised to match the category list in karan's repository, and the projects themselves will be named very similarly to how they are named in karan's repository.

The idea of the projects is to help learn a new programming language, and so some of the projects in this repository may have solutions in multiple programming languages.
